# 🏠 California Housing Prices - Regression Project

This project is a comprehensive regression analysis on the California housing dataset. It demonstrates my ability to handle real-world data, build predictive models, and evaluate their performance using Python and popular data science libraries.

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Predict California housing prices based on various features such as income, location, and population.
- Compare performance between different regression models.
- Practice data cleaning, visualization, and evaluation techniques.

## 🚀 Skills Demonstrated

- 📊 **Data Analysis**: Pandas, NumPy
- 📈 **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- 🧹 **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
- 🤖 **Machine Learning Models**:
  - Linear Regression
  - Random Forest Regressor
- 📦 **Tools & Environment**:
  - Google Colab
  - Kaggle API for dataset fetching

## 📂 Dataset

- [California Housing Prices on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/camnugent/california-housing-prices)

The dataset includes housing data such as:
- Median income
- House age
- Latitude/Longitude
- Median house value

## 📊 Model Evaluation

Models were evaluated based on:
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- R² Score

Comparative results are discussed in the notebook.
